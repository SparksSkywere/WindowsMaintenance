# Windows Maintenance Powershell Script

This is a set of scripts I have made or utilities downloaded (credit below), these scripts can only be ran one after another, so be patient while one script runs after another.

You may also take the scripts and use them in your own programs under the GNU License agreement and credit is given to me.

# From Readme.txt

Quick Readme for the exe file not loading
Make sure you are running administrator on the exe or .ps1 script

1. Run the other ps1 script that will set execution policy to "bypass" do not worry windows will automatically restore the execution policy when the computer is next turned on
2. Then run the WindowsMaintenance exe
